# InfoSec-Tools
This is a a journal of sorts to document my learning of infosec and python programing. I will be adding different tools in the order that I make in hopes of looking back one day and seeing how much I've progressed.

# Tools
1. My first tool is a password generator made in python, ([Passgen.py](https://github.com/Destituentt/InfoSec-Tools/blob/main/Passgen.py)) that uses the **strings** and **random** libs to generate a 12 character password.
2. Second tool is a simple ([UDP Client.py](https://github.com/Destituentt/InfoSec-Tools/blob/main/UDP%20Client.py)) to send a udp packet. To see the message, you can use netcat and use the following command ```nc -ulp 9997```
